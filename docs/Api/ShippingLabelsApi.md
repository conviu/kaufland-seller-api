You can read about Kaufland Shipment Solutions (KSS) soon.  This endpoint provides a temporary link to a PDF file that contains the shipping label.  Please consider shipping restrictions that apply.  `ids_order_units` is a list of order unit IDs that are to be shipped in the same package.  `carriers` is a list of carriers you are able to use to ship the package. If you want to use a specific carrier, you can pass only the desired carrier. The carrier must be one of the following: `GLS`  `package_measurements` are the properties of the package. The `weight` is in grams, the `width`, `height`, and `length` are in centimeters.  If the response is successful, the response will contain the following properties: - `id` is the ID of the shipment label. - `tracking_number` is the tracking number of the shipment. - `carrier` is the carrier used to ship the package. - `download_url` is the URL to download the shipping label, the download url works for 7 days.  If you are using the playground environment, the response will always return a dummy success response.
